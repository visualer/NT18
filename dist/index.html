        NT18 will be held in Peking University (PKU), Beijing, China.<br /><br />
        Peking University is a comprehensive and national key university, which was founded in 1898.
        The campus, known as "Yan Yuan" (the garden of Yan), is situated at Haidian District in the western
        suburb of Beijing,
        with a total area of 274 hectares). It stands near to the Yuanmingyuan Garden and the Summer Palace.<br /><br />
        Peking University is proud of its outstanding faculty, including 53 members of the Chinese Academy of
        Sciences (CAS),
        7 members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), and 14 members of the Third World Academy of
        Sciences (TWAS).<br /><br />
        The university has effectively combined research on important scientific subjects with the training of
        personnel with a
        high level of specialized knowledge and professional skill as demanded by the country's socialist
        modernization.
        It strives not only for improvements in teaching and research work, but also for the promotion of
        interaction and
        mutual promotion among various disciplines.<br /><br />
        Thus Peking University has become a center for teaching and research and a university of a new type,
        embracing
        diverse branches of learning such as basic and applied sciences, social sciences and the humanities, and
        sciences of medicine,
        management, and education. Its aim is to rank among the world's best universities in the future.<br />

				Forbidden City
			</h2>
			<ul class="StarText" style="font-size: 20px;">
				<li>
				<p>The Forbidden City was the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty—the years 1420 to 1912. It is in the center of Beijing, China, and now houses the Palace Museum. It served as the home of emperors and their households as well as the ceremonial and political center of Chinese government for almost 500 years.</p>
				<p>Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). The palace complex exemplifies traditional Chinese palatial architecture, and has influenced cultural and architectural developments in East Asia and elsewhere. The Forbidden City was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987, and is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world.</p>
				<p>Since 1925 the Forbidden City has been under the charge of the Palace Museum, whose extensive collection of artwork and artefacts were built upon the imperial collections of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Part of the museum's former collection is now in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. Both museums descend from the same institution, but were split after the Chinese Civil War. Since 2012, the Forbidden City has seen an average of 15 million visitors annually, and had 16 millions visitors in 2016.</p>

				The National Museum of China
			</h2>
			<ul class="StarText" style="font-size: 20px;">
				<li>
				<p>The National Museum of China (NMC) is located at the east side of Tiananmen Square, opposite the Great Hall of the People. It was founded in February 2003, based on the merging of two previous museums, namely the National Museum of Chinese History and the National Museum of Chinese Revolution. NMC, an integrated national museum under the Ministry of Culture of China, draws equally from both history and art and is dedicated to its collections, exhibitions, research, archeology, public education and cultural communication. Its basic functions are collections of cultural relics and artworks, exhibitions, public education, history and art research and cultural communication.
				</p>
				<p>The predecessor of the Museum of Chinese History was the Preparatory Office of the Museum of Chinese History, founded on July 9, 1912. Upon the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct 1st , 1949, the museum was renamed the Beijing Museum of History, only to be renamed once again as the National Museum of Chinese History in 1959. The predecessor of the Museum of Chinese Revolution was the Preparatory Office of the National Revolution Museum, which was founded in March, 1950 and was given its current name ten years later. In August 1959, with the completion of a new building on the east side of Tiananmen Square, and this housed both museums; it was acclaimed as one of the Ten Great Constructions built to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the People’s Republic of China. On Oct 1st of that same year, the two museums opened to the public.
				</p>
				<p>We hold leading within China, first-class externally as our main objective, people foremost as a principle of development, honest to reality, close to life, friendly to the people as a value, and talent, collection, academics and services as the key points in running the museum. It is of great importance to preserve, inherit, display, and develop the magnificent Chinese culture. Meanwhile, as the most important cultural and art institution in China, NMC not only displays China’s outstanding civilization achievements, but also those of other parts of the world.
				</p>
				<p>To support the public cultural service system and satisfy the learning needs of the community, we strive to promote the historical and cultural knowledge of the general public, in particular young people, while working to nurture civilization and facilitate life-long learning in the cultural sphere and in the classroom.
				</p>
				<p>NMC plays an important role in displaying Chinese culture, cultivating national spirit; as such it is a world leader amongst museums in developing the field of cultural relics.
				</p>
				<p>From March, 2007 to December, 2010, NMC carried out a project to expand the museum so that it now covers 192,000 square meters. Today NMC is the largest museum in the world, with first class facilities and capabilities. With more than forty halls, we have exhibitions of Ancient China and The Road to Rejuvenation on regular display and more than a dozen categories of display related to special exhibitions and international exchange exhibitions. Not only has the museum amassed five thousand years of Chinese art and cultural heritage, the museum itself attests to the long road to revival and provides high-quality exhibitions which reflect the fruits of this world civilization.</p>

				13th International Symposium on Computational Challenges and Tools for Nanotubes (CCTN18)
			</h2>
				

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent significant progress of experimental technique enables us to form low-dimensional materials, such as nanotube, nanoribbon, non-carbon 2D-sheets, and their composites in precise control of their nano-structures, such as chirality, thickness, widths, layer stacking sequences, and so on. Theoretical works to predict new structures/properties, to understand formation mechanisms as well as measured data, have become indispensable to accelerate the speed of research and developments. I believe that the series of Computational Challenges and Tools for Nanotubes (CCTN), since 2005 at Nagano, is one of world leading theory symposia, and am happy to organize CCTN18 as one of parallel symposia in NT18 at Beijing in 2018. The CCTN18 organizing team welcomes participants to discuss recent advance of theoretical works on low-dimensional materials as well as computational techniques some of which can be applied on informatics based on artificial intelligence.</p>

				12th International Workshop on Metrology, Standardization and Industrial Quality of Nanotubes (MSIN18)
			</h2>
				

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This parallel symposium is dedicated to the metrology, standardization and industrial quality of low dimensional materials. Adoption of a new material in industry requires consistency and quality that can only be assured by international standards of measurement. The research community also benefits from standard measurement practices and quality in nanostructures as it facilitates inter-laboratory comparisons of research results. Development of protocols for the definition of sample parameters like composition, purity, stability, homogeneity, dispersability and structural metrics are keys for both research and applications. The MSIN18 workshop strives to bring together the international stakeholders in measurement science and standardization to build consensus on best measurement practices to assure consistency and quality in the field of carbon nanotubes, graphene, and other low dimensional structures.</p>

				About Beijing
			</h2>
			<h3>
				History
			</h3>
			<p>
				Beijing is the capital of China. With 16 districts and over 20 million population,
				it's also the largest city and the political and cultural center. Beijing's history
				dates back to over 3,000 years ago, when the emperor of Western Zhou Dynasty made it
				the capital of one of its feudal states in 12th century B.C. However, it's not until
				Kublai Khan established Yuan Dynasty, that is, 11th century A.D. when Beijing became
				the political center of China. Though several dynasties rose and fell during the next
				800 years, Beijing's political function reinforces, for it remained the capital of China.
				Over these years, old buildings of Beijing has been built, including both palaces
				and residential buildings. They represent the unique style of Chinese traditional
				architecture. The area in which these buildings stay are surrounded by old walls, and
				occupies 2 “core” districts of Beijing.<br /><br />
				After the establishment of People's Republic of China and the economic reform,
				the urban area of Beijing expanded greatly. Areas that were once villages developed as
				residential or commercial regions. Apart from the 2 “core” districts, the new Beijing city
				has 4 “extended function”, 5 “in development”, and 5 “eco-conservation” districts. Haidian
				District, in which Peking University is situated, is among the “extended function”
				districts—the surrounding area of Peking University used to be rural area and farmlands
				before 2000. Now you can take a stroll near the campus, and find it completely different
				from that of 20 years ago.

			<h3>
				Places of Interest
			</h3>
			<h4>
				Forbidden City, or Palace Museum
			</h4>
			<p>
				The Forbidden City is the imperial palace of Ming and Qing dynasties.
				It is a masterpiece of Chinese ancient buildings, with an area of 720,000
				square meters, over 70 palaces and more than 9,000 rooms.
				It is the largest collective of well-preserved wooden-structured building in the world.

				The Summer Palace is the royal garden of the Qing dynasty.
				Built in 1750, it is the most well-preserved royal garden in China.
				Though being destroyed twice in 1860 and in 1900 because of the Opium War
				and Siege of International Legation, it was repaired in 1902, and after the fall of Qing Dynasty,
				it was finally open to the public in 1924.

			<h4>
				Badaling Great Wall
			</h4>
			<p>
				Built in Ming Dynasty, the Badaling Great Wall is the most popular and most complete
				section of Great Wall, acting as an immense fortress to defend Beijing from invasion.
				It is relatively not so steep compared to other section of the Great Wall;
				equipped with telpher, it is also suitable for the seniors to visit.

			<h2>Charter of the Nanotube (NT) Conference Series</h2>
			<p>1. <b>Purpose.</b></p>
			<p>The purpose of the NT conference series is to promote
			scientific progress, to stimulate free exchange of ideas, and to
			publicize progress in nanotube sciences.</p>

			<p>2. <b>Target attendance.</b></p>
			<p>2.1. NT conferences are open to all persons interested and active in
			nanotube research.</p>
			<p>2.2. The number of attendees or presentations per attendee may
			be limited to maintain the informal spirit of communication. Young
			researchers are treated with higher priority.</p>

			<p>3. <b>Format.</b></p>
			<p>3.1. The organizers will assist in maximizing opportunities for
			sharing knowledge in an informal atmosphere.</p>
			<p>3.2. NT conferences are held in one single plenary session.
			Parallel sessions are to be avoided.</p>
			<p>3.3. Presentations of problems and needs is encouraged as much
			as presentation of solutions.</p>
			<p>3.4. Contributions play a key role at NT conferences. At least
			half the conference time shall be devoted to contributed
			presentations.</p>

			<p>4. <b>Contributed presentations.</b></p>
			<p>4.1. To provide maximum exposure to contributed results,
			contributors are invited to summarize their findings in a Poster
			format. The main purpose of Poster presentations is to facilitate
			asynchronous scientific discussions related to each specific
			contribution. It is desirable to have all posters on display
			during the entire conference.</p>
			<p>4.2. The organizers secure adequate time and space for poster
			sessions. Creative ways to enhance communications, including
			refreshments, are encouraged.</p>
			<p>4.3. Poster+ sessions, consisting of brief 2 minute/2 viewgraph
			summaries of contributions, may precede Poster sessions, to
			enhance the exchange of information in a balanced manner. All
			contributors are encouraged to expose their findings to everyone
			in this way if Poster+ sessions are offered.</p>
			<p>4.4. At large conferences, Poster+ presentations may be
			substituted by a brief overview of the topic of a focussed poster
			session, presented by an expert in the field at the beginning of
			the session. Referring to specific contributions in the session,
			the Poster Chair should summarize the major progress, the major
			obstacles, and desirable future directions in the field. Ideally,
			this should occur in a democratic manner, representing all/most
			contributions. All contributors are encouraged to communicate
			their findings to their assigned Poster Chair for presentation
			well ahead of the conference.</p>

			<p>5. <b>Invited presentations.</b></p>
			<p>5.1. Invited presentations are selected in a democratic way by
			members of the advisory board. Presentation of invited talks is
			reserved for leading, active researchers, not their substitutes.
			The selection of topics and speakers should reflect the most
			significant progress and cover the entire active nanotube field.
			The advisors will resist pressure to select invited talks on other
			grounds than scientific merit.</p>
			<p>5.2. NT conference organizers should generally avoid inviting
			the same presenter at two consecutive conferences. To avoid
			conflicts of interest, the organizers should generally avoid
			inviting contributions of organizers and advisory board members.
			</p>

			<p>6. <b>Venue.</b></p>
			<p>6.1. To pay respect to the international character of nanotube
			research, two consecutive meetings should not be held on the same
			continent.</p>
			<p>6.2. The conference should preferentially be held a location
			associated with or close to an institution active in nanotube
			research.</p>
			<p>6.3. Convenience of the conference facilities is preferred to
			luxury. Modest conference accommodations are to be preferred to
			reduce the conference expenses of participants and to encourage
			attendance.</p>

			<p>7. <b>Financial matters.</b></p>
			<p>7.1. NT conferences are organized in a non-profit way. The
			organizers undertake any reasonable efforts to secure external
			sponsorship covering local and travel expenses of invited
			speakers, support student attendance, and reduce the conference
			fee. Any excess revenue is passed on to organizers of the sequel
			conference.</p>
			<p>7.2. Financial liability for the NT conference rests with the
			organizers.</p>

			<p>8. <b>parallel symposia.</b></p>
			<p>8.1. parallel symposia form an integral part of NT
			conferences. </p>
			<p>8.2. Logistics of parallel symposia is taken care of by the
			NT conference, the scientific program is left to the parallel
			organizers.</p>
			<p>8.3. At least one of the parallel symposium organizers is member
			of the national committee of the NT conference.</p>

			<p>9. <b>Miscellaneous.</b></p>
			<p>9.1. NT organizers promote the spirit of informal communication
			also by providing name badges to participants. Both first and
			family names should be spelled out and printed in an easily
			legible, large font. Academic titles should be avoided.</p>

			<p>10. <b>Regulation.</b></p>
			<p>All issues related to the organization of Nanotube Conferences
			are regulated by the
			<a href="http://www.photon.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/nt/SCNCstatutes.html" target="_blank">Steering Committee
			of Nanotube Conferences (SCNC)</a>.</p>
